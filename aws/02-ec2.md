### AWS EC2

Create an infrastructure to have 2 EC2 instances:

1. `news-aggregator` server
2. `news-aggregator` client

Establish communication between them. As a result of the task, you will have to make sure the client is able to interact
with news-aggregator server.

### Hint

Both EC2 instances have to be inside the same VPC, have a security group, which will allow only communication
between them, and custom network interfaces.

### **PLS USE FREE TIER EC2 instance type**
