## Networking exercises
Exercise1 and Exercise2 should be solved **manually**, the solution of these tasks should be described and explained
in the Google Document. The Google Document should be shared with Vitalii Shevchenko and Nikita Matrosov TeamDev accounts.

### Exercise1
Using the given IP addresses, you will have to:
1. Determine which class of network they belong to
2. Calculate a network IP address
3. Calculate a netmask
4. Find a broadcast IP address on the given network.

**IP addresses**:
1. 192.168.0.106
2. 172.16.13.98
3. 10.0.0.3

### Exercise2
Do the below IP addresses belong to the same subnet ?
**IP addresses**:
1. 127.73.18.240 - 137.114.177.17. The mask is **9**
2. 47.88.172.145 - 47.88.178.192. The mask is **21**

**Hint**: To find out if addresses belong to the same subnet, you need to get the address networks for each
of the addresses and compare the addresses of the networks.

### Exercise3
Read must read topics/books.

### Exercise4 **for experts** (very optional)
Simulate first seven labs from here: https://www.packettracernetwork.com/labs/packettracerlabs.html in `PacketTracer` application.
The result of this task should be a `.pka` file, which you will have to upload to a Google Drive and share access with
Vitalii Shevchenko and Nikita Matrosov TeamDev accounts.
