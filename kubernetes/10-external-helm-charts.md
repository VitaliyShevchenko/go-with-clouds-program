### Description

We need to integrate two additional Helm charts:

1. cert-manager: This will facilitate the management of certificates and Certificate Authorities (CAs).
2. VPA (Vertical Pod Autoscaler): This will enable the configuration of vertical scaling for the resources.

#### cert-manager

The HTTPS server should utilize a certificate generated by cert-manager instead of a hardcoded certificate within the
source code.

#### Scaling

Both Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) should be configured for the news-aggregator
server to handle increased load effectively.
