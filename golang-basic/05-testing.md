### Unit Tests

Go through the following articles to get a basic understanding on how to write unit tests in Go:

* [Go Test Your Code: An introduction to testing in Go](https://medium.com/rate-engineering/go-test-your-code-an-introduction-to-effective-testing-in-go-6e4f66f2c259)
    - explains how to build a simple test
* [An Introduction to Testing in Go](https://tutorialedge.net/golang/intro-testing-in-go/) - shows the basic unit tests and table
  driven tests
* [Advanced Go Testing Tutorial](https://tutorialedge.net/golang/advanced-go-testing-tutorial/) - shows how to separate unit and
  integration tests
* (Optional) Get familiar with BDD testing lib: [Ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/)
  and [Gomega](https://onsi.github.io/gomega/).  
  It will be useful later on and it is used in our enterprise project.
