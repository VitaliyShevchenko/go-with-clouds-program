### Description

Develop API for news aggregator. This API will collect, process, and
provide access to news articles from multiple sources, delivering a unified and user-friendly interface for accessing
diverse news content. (check [01-project-description.md](01-project-description.md) for more details).

As a result of this task, it's expected to have a document with a design (specification) for an API of your app.

Specification template:
```text
- Feature/Project Name: <string>
- Engineer name: <string>

# Summary
One paragraph explanation of the feature/project.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# APIs design

Explain APIs you want to introduce.
- How will they work?
- What will be the input arguments? What will be the output?
- Provide examples of models which will be used.
- How will they interact with existing APIs?


# Unresolved questions

Here you can put all opened questions or things you need to clear with other folks. 
```
